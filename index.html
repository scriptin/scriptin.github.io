        I create software for a living and as a hobby, mostly web applications and libraries in TypeScript.
        Starting from my teenage years, I experimented with a wide variety of programming languages,
        ranging from Assembly to functional programming, and have written and read tons
        of code, in projects of all sizes.

        I have a degree in IT security, and even though I've never worked
        as a security engineer, SQL injections are things I know about and look for
        when I write or review code. I even made a small research project about
        <a href="https://github.com/scriptin/node-timing-attack">timing attacks in Node.js</a>.

        where I study foreign languages and contribute sentences.
