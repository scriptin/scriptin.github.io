    <p>
        I code for a living and as a hobby, mostly web applications and libraries in TypeScript.
        Starting from my teenage years, I tried programming languages from Assembly
        to <a href="https://coq.inria.fr/">Coq</a>, and have written and read tons
        of code, in projects ranging from hello-worlds to cloud-based apps with millions of users.
        My other interests include natural languages, science, sci-fi, cyber-security,
        and art (I can draw some fancy pixel-art).
    </p>
    <p>
        You can find some of my pet projects
        <a href="https://github.com/scriptin">on GitHub</a>:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <a href="https://github.com/scriptin/jmdict-simplified">jmdict-simplified</a>
            is a converted version of <a href="http://www.edrdg.org/jmdict/j_jmdict.html">JMdict</a>,
            JMnedict, Kanjidic, and Kradfile/Radkfile in a user-friendly JSON format (see
            <a href="https://scriptin.github.io/jmdict-simplified/">documentation</a>),
            created out of frustration after struggling with the original XML files.
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="https://scriptin.github.io/kanji-frequency/">Kanji Frequency</a>
            is a unique dataset of usage data of Japanese kanji characters, maintained since 2015.
            Originally created for my Japanese dream app - which never happened - it includes
            data from multiple corpora, covering most styles (e.g. academic writing, or fiction books)
            of Japanese language.
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="https://github.com/scriptin/is-han">is-han</a> is a small Node.js library
            for properly detecting Han characters (Kanji, Hanzi, Hanja). Because, apparently,
            it's not as simple as just using a regex with two code points.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        I have a degree in IT security, and even though I've never worked
        as a security engineer, SQL injections are things I know about and look for
        when I write or review code. I even made a small research project about
        <a href="https://github.com/scriptin/node-timing-attack">timing attacks in Node.js</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can also find
        <a href="https://tatoeba.org/en/user/profile/scriptin">me on Tatoeba.org</a>,
        where I study languages and contribute sentences.
